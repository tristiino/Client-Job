This application is being developed as a team learning project in SDEV265 "System Software Analysis & Projects" at Ivy Tech Community College.

The fictional client, Anonymous Builders, sends estimators to the field to collect data about potential customers and their respective job sites. They are requesting an application that will allow these employees to input the collected data using their personal mobile devices, store that data in the cloud, then allow it to be retrieved via mobile or office workstation.

See documentation directory for further details about user requirements and planned architecture.
